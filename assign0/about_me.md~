I don't know if anything about me can be considered interesting, but I'll go
through a small list of things about me:

*I like to play video games:
    *I own a gaming PC (a nice one) and like to play CS:GO, Overwatch, PUBG,
    etc.
    *I am the proud owner of a Nintendo Switch and wish to Heavily expand my
    library of games
*I'm a drummer, or I at least was before coming to school, and you can find our
music at hollywisenw.bandcamp.com
*I recently learned how to make fried rice.
*I listen to a ton of different types of music.
    *Pop-punk
    *Jazz
    *Old school Emo
    *Chillhop
    *Alternative/Indie/Folk
    *Math-Rock

That's all I care to fit on this. Did I pass?

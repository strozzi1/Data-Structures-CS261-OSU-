I have indeed signed up for Piazza

I don't know if anything about me can be considered interesting, but I'll go
through a small list of things about me:

 * I like to play video games:
    * I own a gaming PC (a nice one) and like to play CS:GO, Overwatch, PUBG
    * I am the proud owner of a Nintendo Switch
 * I was a drummer before college, hollywisenw.bandcamp.com, check it out. 
 * I recently learned how to make fried rice.
 * I listen to a ton of different types of music.
    * Pop-punk
    * Jazz
    * Old school Emo
    * Chillhop
    * Alternative/Indie/Folk
    * Math-Rock
    * Etc.

That's all I care to fit on this. Did I pass?
